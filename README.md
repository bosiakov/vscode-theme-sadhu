## Recommended VS Code settings

To achieve the lowest level of visual noise, we recommend the following settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Ctrl + Shift + p -> Open Settings (JSON)`):

```
    "breadcrumbs.enabled": false,
    "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    "editor.renderIndentGuides": false,
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false
```

## Motivation

Having a minimal amount of visual noise means a clear mind.

Sadhu uses minimal highlighting and does not highlight standard language keywords. They are the most obvious part of any program.

Sadhu doesn’t use font variations. It’s hard to scan code when it jumps between normal, **bold** and *italics* all the time.

1. Go to `Extensions`
2. Search for `sadhu`
3. Install
