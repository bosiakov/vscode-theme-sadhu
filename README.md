# Sadhu Theme

An ascetic vscode theme for those who have found Bodhi.

## Motivation

Having a minimal amount of visual noise means a clear mind.

Sadhu uses minimal highlighting and does not highlight standard language keywords. They are the most obvious part of any program.

Sadhu doesn’t use font variations. It’s hard to scan code when it jumps between normal, **bold** and *italics* all the time.
